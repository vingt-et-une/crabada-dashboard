# crabada-dashboard
BreederDao apps

This project aims to create a dashboard that can display relevant information and market trends on the decentralized NFT game, Crabada.
This project was made to fulfill the developer's job application to BreederDAO. The sales data was provided by the company covering all
sales from the start of Crabada til Jan 24, 2022. Crab data was pulled using the Crabada API for all crabs that were in the market til 
Jan 24, 2022. The Dashboard is built using plotly-dash, a dashboard-making package built on top of Flask.
